# UpRanger

### This is an awesome pack for PRS
I found that I'm an old school and prefer a one chamber pack which seems to be personal preferece.  This is perfect for those who like to run highly organzied and it's very customizable with the added removable side pouches.

### Description from Eberlystock's website 
Inspired by a champion 3-Gunner who didn’t like the normal sequence of dismounting a pack face-down and rolling the straps in the dirt, the R3 UpRanger™ changes the game. Drop the R3 on its polycarbonate outer face and unzip from the harness side for quick access to everything you need without unnecessary wear or dirt. Whether you use it for the range, or a durable and secure camera bag, the R3 UpRanger will take it all. Add on Sidewinder rifle cases for an all-in-one 3-Gun pack.

## Purchase Process

1. Payment via PayPal Friends only
2. Paypal info will be sent once I get your shipping address and we agree on final price with shipping
3. The shipping default is ground and will occur within 2 business days of final agreement. 
    - I get great pricing so I doubt those fees ever be more $30 and under $20 for smaller items for the lower 48 states.  
    - I don't charge extra for the shipping or packing. 
    - Other shipping options are available if you want faster times. Just let me know when you reach out. 

Prices listed are fair and final and I'm not interested in negotiating so if you're wanting to haggle don't reach out and waste your time and mine.
