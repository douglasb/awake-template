## Annealeeze Version 2

This is a dependable unit that knocks out 100 rounds with little need for attention. I would routinely work on other projects at the bench while running the unit. I had some issues keeping the flame consistent using the small propane canisters so I would recommend hooking it up to a larger tank.

    - Other shipping options are available if you want faster times. Just let me know when you reach out. 

Prices listed are fair and final and I'm not interested in negotiating so if you're wanting to haggle don't reach out and waste your time and mine.
